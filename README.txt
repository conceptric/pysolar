# PySolar package #

This package contains tools I use to process my solar observation data. The 
majority of my work is VLF radio based, but other tools may be added.

There are tools for importing and manipulating data from the 
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) satellites. These data 
can include any of the instruments on these satellites, but focus on X-Ray and 
Magnetometry.

Whilst you're free to clone this repo for your own use, please note that it's 
in a very ALPHA state, and could change beyond recognition according to my whim.
